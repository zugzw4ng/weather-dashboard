# Weather Dashboard

## Description
  I created a weather dashboard page from scratch using HTML/CSS/Javascript. I applied Bootstrap and JQuery to the program to support the structure and styling, and used API calls through Openweather API to dynamically generate weather data and save it in localStorage. I learned how to properly utilize an API key and functions that create URL fragments to parse for specific weather data.

## Installation & Usage

The dashboard has an input field where the user can input a city, click search, then the current weather and 5 day forecast are presented on the screen. The city is also saved and presented in a list so that the user can check any previously visited city's data with ease. When clicking the clear saved button, the list of saved cities is cleared. 

The program can be accessed directly at https://zugzw4ng.github.io/weather-dashboard/
